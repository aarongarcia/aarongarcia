  - question: Who the hell is Pecos?
    answer: Whoa take it easy. I thought we covered it in the clever copy we wrote up above but now I see that we didn't. We stand corrected. If we may turn the tables, I think what's more important is why you scrolled down and clicked this faq with such an unsettled mind. Perhaps a cold drink in an unpretenious bar with a good friend or book might be in order. Report back later and let us know how you're doing.
